commands:
  # Kind is configured to expose port 8080 to the host, so any pod that binds the 8080 port
  # of the host is reachable from the host that's running the tests
  # If the curl returns a 200 it means that the envoy sidecar has correctly picked the config
  # from the discovery service and correctly forwarding the requests to the nginx container
