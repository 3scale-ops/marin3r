# Development

The development process for marin3r is based on running locally the operator against a local Kind (Kubernetes In Docker) cluster. In order to test any change or new feature do the following:

Generate a new image locally by issuing `make docker-build`. Even if the operator can be run locally without building the image, marin3r is a single binary that contains both the code for the operator, the discovery service server and the mutating webhook, so you need to generate the image at least for the former two.

Run a Kind cluster locally by using the following command. The Makefile will take care of downloading the proper `kind` binary:

```bash
make kind-create
```

The make target will also load the latest locally generated image into the cluster, which will be always tagged as `quay.io/3scale/marin3r:test`. This tag is updated each time you issue a `make docker-build` command.

Once the Kind cluster is up and running export the kubeconfig file into your shell:

```bash
export KUBECONFIG=${PWD}/kubeconfig
```

**NOTE**: remember to export the `KUBECONFIG` variable each time you open a new shell and want to interact with the Kind cluster. This variable is already exported in the makefile so any make target that makes use of `kubectl` will use the proper kubeconfig file to talk to the cluster.

You have now two options.

## Run the operator locally

Install the CRDs in the Kind cluster.

```bash
make install
```

Start tart the operator out-of-cluster. The operator will run with the admin priviledges given by the kubeconfig file.

```bash
make run
```

Deploy a DiscoveryService instance. There are several samples in the `examples` directory of the repo.

```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/e2e/discoveryservice/instance.yaml
```

## Run the operator inside the cluster

Just use kustomize to deploy everything into the Kind cluter:

```bash
make kind-deploy
```

The operator will be deployed in the `marin3r-system` namespace and will run with the rbac permissions assigned to it.

## Run a standalone discovery service locally

In the case that you are developing functionality specific to the discovery service you can locally run the discovery service server and and envoy container running inside your local docker that connects to it.

Start by running the discovery service server. The discovery service server run the EnvoyConfig and EnvoyConfigRevision controllers itself, so you need to have the local Kind cluster up and running beforehand.

```bash
make run-ds
```

In a different shell run an envoy pod that is already configured to talk to this discovery service server.

```bash
make run-envoy
```

You will see in the logs of the discovery service server that the envoy process connects to it as soon as it starts to request configurations:

```bash
[...]

[...]
```

You can now deploy EnvoyConfig resources to the Kind cluster using the `nodeID=envoy1` as it is the one configured for the envoy process running in the docker container.

## Test envoy configurations locally

The process of developing envoy configurations can be cumbersome. It is faster to first test the configurations locally first to check for syntax errors or deprecation warnings.

First, create a static envoy config file. You can take `examples/local/static-config.yaml` as an example and add your resources under `static_resources`. Then use the following target to run the container with the given config:

```bash
make test-envoy-config CONFIG=<path to your config>
```

For example:

```bash
â–¶ make test-envoy-config CONFIG=examples/local/static-config.yaml
docker run -ti --rm \
        --network=host \
        -v $(pwd)/examples/local/static-config.yaml:/config.yaml \
        envoyproxy/envoy:v1.14.1 \
        envoy -c /config.yaml

[...]
```

You can use a specific version of envoy using the following command:

```bash
make test-envoy-config CONFIG=<path to your config> ENVOY_VERSION=<version>
```

You can add additional arguments to the envoy command line, for example to increase logs levels:

```bash
make test-envoy-config CONFIG=examples/local/static-config.yaml ARGS="--component-log-level http:debug"
```

## Testing

### Unit tests

Unit tests can be run with:

```bash
make test
```

### e2e tests

End to end tests are implemented using [KUTTL](https://kuttl.dev/docs/). KUTTL uses Kind to run tests defined declaratively using yaml. The e2e tests can be run with:

```bash
make e2e
```
